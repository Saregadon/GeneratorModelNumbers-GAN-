# GAN for Model numbers

Header Information:

There is a brief description stating that this GAN generates plausible handwritten digits.
The problem is framed as a binary classification.
There are some comments regarding package versions and installations.
Import Statements:

Various libraries and modules are imported, including TensorFlow, Keras, and other utilities.
Discriminator Model (define_discriminator function):

// REQUIRESMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION ----------------------------------------
#Generative Adversarial Network
#Generates plausible handwritten digits
#Binary Classification problem
#converts from [0,255] to [0,1]
#if need keras >= 2.2
#python3.7 -m pip install keras==2.1.5
#example of training a gan on mnist
#keras==2.1.5 tensorflow==1.13.1
// REQUIRESMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION ----------------------------------------

This function defines the discriminator, a model that distinguishes between real and fake handwritten digits.
The model uses Convolutional layers, Dropout, Leaky ReLU activation functions, and outputs a single value using the sigmoid activation function.
The Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss are used to compile the discriminator.
Generator Model (define_generator function):

This function defines the generator, a model that generates handwritten digits from random noise.
The generator uses Dense layers, Reshape layers, Conv2D Transpose (upsampling) layers, and outputs an image with tanh activation.
Combined GAN Model (define_gan function):

This function creates the full GAN model by combining the previously defined generator and discriminator.
The discriminator's weights are frozen during training of the GAN so that only the generator learns from the discriminator's feedback.
Data Loading and Preprocessing (load_real_samples function):

The MNIST dataset is loaded.
Images are rescaled from [0,255] to [-1,1], making them suitable for the tanh activation in the generator.
Data Sampling Functions:

generate_real_samples selects real images from the MNIST dataset.
generate_latent_points creates random points in the latent space.
generate_fake_samples uses the generator to create fake handwritten digits.
Utility Functions:

save_plot saves plots of generated images.
summarize_performance evaluates the discriminator's performance on real and fake images, saves generated images as plots, and saves the generator's model.
Training Function (train function):

The discriminator is trained on both real and fake images.
The GAN model is trained to improve the generator. The generator tries to produce images that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real images.
Training progress is printed, and periodic evaluations are done using the summarize_performance function.
Execution:

The size of the latent space is set.
The discriminator, generator, and GAN models are created.
The MNIST dataset is loaded.
The GAN is trained using the train function.
Overall, this code sets up a standard GAN to generate handwritten digits using the architecture and training dynamics typical for GANs. The discriminator tries to get better at distinguishing real from fake, while the generator tries to get better at fooling the discriminator.
